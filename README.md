Based on tutorials by Renaissance Coders (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4CCSwmU04MiCnps1DRmwIEEH7gP9X3qq).
Mage, rogue, and warrior icons are modified versions of icons created by Jime Mosqueda (https://jimemosqueda.gumroad.com/l/dndicons).

I modified the tutorial by adding an editor, called Enemy Editor, that can edit the data of any characters made with the Enemy Designer. The Enemy Editor
displays the data of the character, based on the type of character, allowing you to view and/or edit any of its data. The Enemy Editor can also rename the
character, but any instantiated characters will not have their names changed in any scenes, only the name found in their data, as this is slow and could
introduce lookup problems in future scripts.

Specfic features that are special to the Enemy Editor include the resizing sections when popups appear and changing the window's theme when a different
character type is selected.
